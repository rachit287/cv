    <h3>My hobbies, and passion</h3>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>I have always been passionate, and somewhat decent at football. I take pride in being athletically proficient as mind and body <br / >
      should be in sync with one another.</li>
      <li>I don't count while I read, and that's why I love reading. Books are one of the finer ways to unlock and tap into your wisdom.</li>
      <li>I have always maintained a standard for myself at the gym, and I don't plan on slacking anytime before 70.</li>
      <li>I have a guilty pleasure of indulging in light-hearted sitcoms and intense movies.</li>
      <li>I am an ardent follower of sports, and sporting icons. The lessons on the field are the most crucial ones.</li>
